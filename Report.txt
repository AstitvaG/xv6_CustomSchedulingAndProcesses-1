On running benchmarks the following results were seen:

MLFQ performs best
PBS also performs pretty good 
RR performs not that great
FCFS with non premption performs poorly.


For the MLFQ question:

A process may come again and again in to the end of queue and would first go up the queue and then come down again, hence may run to never completion.
